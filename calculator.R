## Part 5 [6 Marks]
## Write a function that prompts a user to choose an operation between six 
## available operations: 1) Add, 2) Subtract, 3) Multiply, 4) Divide, 5) Factors 
## and 6) Prime number. The first four operations will ask user to provide two 
## numbers and add, subtract, multiply and divide them accordingly. The fifth 
## operation calculates the factors of a number and sixth operation checks if a 
## number is prime. 
## Please save your code to a file named calculator.R. The output should look 
## something like this when the user runs the function:
## 
##     [1] "******Simple R Calculator - Select operation: ******"
##     [1] "1.Add"
##     [1] "2.Subtract"
##     [1] "3.Multiply"
##     [1] "4.Divide"
##     [1] "5.Factors"
##     [1] "6.Prime"
##     Enter choice [1/2/3/4/5/6]: 4 #prompting the user to select an operation
##     Enter first number: 20 #prompting the user to enter the first number
##     Enter second number: 4 #prompting the user to enter the second number [1] "20
##     / 4 = 5"
##     [1] "******Simple R Calculator - Select operation: ******"
##     [1] "1.Add"
##     [1] "2.Subtract"
##     [1] "3.Multiply"
##     [1] "4.Divide"
##     [1] "5.Factors"
##     [1] "6.Prime"
##     Enter choice [1/2/3/4/5/6]: 5
##     Enter the number: 120
##     #prompting the user to select an operation
##     #prompting the user to enter the input
##     [1] "The factors of 120 are:"
##     [1] 1
##     [1] 2
##     [1] 3
##     [1] 4
##     [1] 5
##     [1] 6
##     [1] 8
##     [1] 10
##     [1] 12
##     [1] 15
##     [1] 20
##     [1] 24
##     [1] 30
##     [1] 40
##     [1] 60
##     [1] 120

## For this function you will need to use the 'readline' function in R to take 
## input from the user (terminal).
## Please read the help page for this function via '?readline' and make sure 
## that you know how to use it.
